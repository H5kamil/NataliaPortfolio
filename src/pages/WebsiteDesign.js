              <div>
                Previously established hierarchy of website was based on two main products: Tellyo Pro and Tellyo On Demand.
                 Tellyo was resigning of promoting Tellyo On Demand which was a solution for smaller companies and pay-per-use clients focused. 
                 Company has centred on presenting new advanced live video editing solution: Tellyo Stream Studio. 
                 Tellyo Pro remained unchanged as the core of the company, 
                 but the additional features polished lately were needed to present for wider audience. <br/>
                 Main goal was to present those two products as the complementary but at the same time highlight their independent functionalities. 
                 All that align with the Tellyo brand principles to produce a better experience, generate awareness, 
                 boost credibility and rise the number of new users. You can check previous website version here.

                how competitors and users behave. Starting design process we gathered all the
                necessary information, established the scope of work. By taking a more holistic 
                approach we focused on showing our solutions right. Explaining all advantages 
                of each characteristics and showing main product, Tellyo Pro while Tellyo
                Stream Studio as the additional benefit.</div>

            <div>Building the information architecture for this website took lots of things 
              into account, as well as organizing the information in a logical way. 
              Design a proper site structure required principles that are based on the 
              understanding that our focus should be purely the structure - something that 
              can be shown with maps and flowcharts, so that all critical user journeys 
              were all covered with needed informations. Weâ€™ve got to really understand 
              the functionality of the site. Once these requirements were met, we started 
              begin optimizing the IA.</div>

            This process helped us prioritize, better clasify and organize gathered 
            information and needed elements. When dealing with constantly changing 
            businesses reguirements and new features of each product, there were a 
            number of amendments and updates, but main assumption was constant.

              <div>Home page needed a completly new design. Showcasing the flow that potential user will follow when start to use Tellyo was the main idea. 
                It should be simple and easy to understand with no aditional tetx. 
                Having to use only title, we had to explain clearly what Tellyo is about and quickly establish emotional connection with the audience. 
                Intriguing them but at the same time make the experience irresistibly professional. Home page had many different approaches:

              <div>Since the site should be simple and easy to navigate and content is always getting bigger, 
                I had to make it easy scalable. Taking into considerations business goals, I had in mind that we need to focus on sales and company 
                reputation but also engaged and encourage new customers. Keeping up with the established IA and all graphics assets in mind, 
                I designed a tiles grid that the best suits Case Study section.

              In final design solution, we aimed to improve the content hierarchy and to 
              clearly portray the companyâ€™s brand and services offered. Design closely 
              harmonize with Tellyo Design system. I believe we improved the ease of listing,
