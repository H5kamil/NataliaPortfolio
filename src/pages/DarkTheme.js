              Growing fast as live video editing and production company, Tellyo has to 
              follow the trail of dark theme mode. It was a request of clients but 
              also industry requirements. 
              Project contains a comprehensive elaboration of colors, usage, 
              application, guidelines and tokens.

              <div>Tellyo is an advanced, cloud-based live video production, editing, streaming and 
                distribution platform. It gives broadcasters and rights holders the solutions to easily 
                create engaging videos from live content, and share them to social and digital channels 
                in real-time. <br/>
                It was crucial to ensure dark theme mode for users to improve visual ergonomics by reducing 
                eye strain, as the professional video producers spend a lot of time editing video content.

            <div>The challenge</div>
            <div>Our ambition was to create a strong foundation: providing clear and easy to use color 
                system for designers and developers. Establish well-balanced, harmonious and accessible 
                dark theme. <br/>
                Main goal was to define and develop practical solution when using and switching color 
                palettes so that final users can change it easily when working with Tellyo. There was a 
                need to implement dark theme in Video Editor, Tellyo Pro Dashboard and Stream Studio products.
            </div>
            <div>
                Main problem was that there was no clear arrangement in terms of color palletes in Dev Team. 
                Developers were working by copying the same (or almost the same) colors and combining 
                different tokens every time they had to, which at the end cause a big mess and was really 
                time-consuming.

              <div>Previously established hierarchy of darksite was based on two main 
                products: Tellyo Pro and Tellyo On Demand. Tellyo was resigning of 
                promoting Tellyo On Demand which was a solution for smaller companies 
                and pay-per-use clients focused. Company has centred on presenting new 
                solution: Tellyo Stream Studio. While main product, Tellyo Pro remains 
                unchanged as the core of the company, the additional features polished 
                lately were needed to present for wider audience. 
                Main goal was to present those two products as the complementary but 
                at the same time 
                hihlight their independent functionalities. All that align with the 
                Tellyo brand principles to produce a better experience.</div>

            <div>Building the information architecture for this darksite took lots of things 
              into account, as well as organizing the information in a logical way. 
              Design a proper site structure required principles that are based on the 
              understanding that our focus should be purely the structure - something that 
              can be shown with maps and flowcharts, so that all critical user journeys 
              were all covered with needed informations. Weâ€™ve got to really understand 
              the functionality of the site. Once these requirements were met, we started 
              begin optimizing the IA.</div>

            number of amendments and updates, but main assumption was constant.
